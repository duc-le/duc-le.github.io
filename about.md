I'm a freelance security researcher from Vietnam. My researches focus on Windows Kernels, reverse engineering, malware analysis and system programming.

In my freetime I play CTF, write code and solve crackme challenges.

PS: Thank my beloved Honey for being my inspiration and for correcting my grammar :)
