# About
My name is Duc Le, I'm a freelance computer security researcher from Vietnam. My research focuses on Windows Kernels, malware analysis and system programming.

In my freetime I play CTF, write code and solve crackme challenges.

This is my personal blog hosted from github using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) theme.
